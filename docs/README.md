## Baltimore Golang Presentation

The `baltgo-cgo.slide` file contains the presentation I gave for the Baltimore Golang Group on March 6th. It is mostly in the same condition, but some of the code snippets are off because I now point to active code in this repo.

To view the slides:
1. Download the [go present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present) application
2. Clone this repo and naviagte to the directory in a terminal 
3. Run `present baltgo-cgo.slide`
4. The present too should give you a URL to navigate to 

This repo contains all the code mentioned, so you will probably be better off viewing hte complete source files when you need to.
